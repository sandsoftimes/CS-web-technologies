in the name of ALLAH ALMIGHTY

src folder will have components probes and components states

app.js is a component and it is displaying the things

class based components vs function based components

by react we can reuse components very easily 

single-page-framework

index.html---->also an entry point

index.js---->entry point

app.js is our whole site

create react app---you will start developing the site from the app.js file

app.js--->we will edit this file

components:

function-based (new trend)

class-based

function based:

function(){
return(
//jsx
)
}

everything in return is called as jsx

everything in the return will be displayed on the page

jsx will have all the html. 

we can use js with the same html in jsx 

class not allowed

we use className in html in jsx

we can only return a single tag from the return func of app()

jsx only return 1 fragment from the app.js file

next we will study about the components in more detail
